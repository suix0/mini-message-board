## Reflection

This project was my first ever Express project. This project was part of the Nodejs curriculum in The Odin Project for learners like me to implement what I have learned so far about the MVC architecture implementation in Express.

What I built is basically a place where users can post messages towards a certain someone in their life anonymously.

What made this project challenging was probably implementing a database. Initially, this project was made without a database, storing only messages in an array. Implementing a database and converting methods to queries was challenging but as I was implementing it, I was learning a lot which made my next Express projects easier.

The tools I used in this project is `Nodejs` as my JavaScript runtime environment, `Express` for making it easier to build backednd applications, `EJS` for the view templates, and `PostgreSQL` for the database.
